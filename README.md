Python 3 list. Topic on lists

There are several functions here that perform different task of list

main()
This function should call the other functions to test and demonstrate them. Design this function yourself.

sumOfOdd(intList)
The parameter intList is supposed to be a list of integers.
The function returns the sum of the ​odd​ integers from intList, and leaves intList ​not modified​​. For instance, given [1,2,3,4], the function returns 4.
The function performs no I/O.

productOfEven(intList)
The parameter intList is supposed to be a list of integers.
The function returns the product (multiplication) of the ​even​ integers from intList, and leaves intList ​not modified​​.
For instance, given [1,2,3,4], the function returns 8.
The function performs no I/O.

membersDivisibleBy3(intList)
The parameter intList is supposed to be a list of integers.
The function ​returns a new list​​ containing ​only the integers from the original list that are divisible by 3​, in the same order, and leaves intList not modified.
For instance, given [1,2,3,4,2,3,6], the function returns [3,3,6].
The function performs no I/O.

changeList(intList)
The parameter intList is supposed to be a list of integers. The function ​modifies​​ intList:
● For odd integers 5 is ​added​ and then the result is ​divided​ by 2
● Even integers are divided by 2.
This function does not return anything. (void)
For instance, the parameter [1,2,3,4] should become [3,1,4,2]. The function performs no I/O.

isReverse(intListOne, intListTwo)
The parameters intListOne and intListTwo are supposed to be lists of integers.
The function will ​return true if​​ intListTwo is the reversed version of intListOne.
The function will ​return false if​​ intListTwo is NOT the reversed version of intListOne. The function performs no I/O.
